相關單元	不分單元/全部學生
簡述	Dear all,

In this homework, your goal is to implement an air mouse interface. You can set up a webcam or a kinect to capture and track your hand-made button, which reveals a red circle when mouse-up and a blue circle when mouse-down. Once the event is detected, you can apply the event to drag an image or launch a software. 

TA will show you and explain his example codes at this Wednesday morning. We also can discuss if you have problems on making the button, thanks.

Good luck,
YuShuen
